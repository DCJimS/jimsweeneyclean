<p>Last week it was announced that the team of CSC and Microsoft won the award to migrate all of the Federal Aviation Administration.s (FAA) email to the Microsoft SaaS Cloud using Office 365. But that wasn.t all that was in the announcement. As part of the federal government.s new .Shared Services. policy, it was announced that all of the Department of Transportation (including its 12 other agencies) will also be able to migrate their email as part of this contract.</p>

<p>First, I would like to congratulate the FAA. This is a great example of a federal agency that has taken the initiative to make substantial cost savings while improving services to its user community through the use of the Cloud. Taking this a step further, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) now requiring agencies to submit data for the new shared services initiatives, the FAA has outpaced the rest of the government with a real shared services approach to email in the Cloud.</p>

<p>And, let me also congratulate the contract winners. Great job on the win and I wish you success in the implementation phase of the contract. I cannot wait to see the cost savings that come out of this procurement when the transition is complete.</p>

<p>Today I am celebrating. Not because GTSI received another contract award, but because the FAA is leading the charge towards the SaaS Cloud model for the entire federal government. To the many folks at the FAA that I have had the privilege to work with over the last several years: congratulations. Job well done!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
