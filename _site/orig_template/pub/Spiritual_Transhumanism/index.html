<p>The future is much closer than we think. It is predicted by leading futurists and scientists, such that many of our children will be able to choose freely between physical immortality and death. Our children&#8217;s children will see an age of nanotechnology-enhanced bodies, group minds, and the merging of organic and computational intelligence.</p>

<p>This age carries grave threats to human spirituality, as many individuals choose freely a gilded cage, trapped in the physical plane&#8230; forever. This age also offers the unprecedented opportunity to become creator gods, as our technology becomes &#8220;sufficiently advanced to be indistinguishable from magic&#8221;. Spiritual Transhumans are needed to bridge this gap &#8211; people willing to embrace and experiment with an evolution that is both spiritual and technological, all on a foundation of integrity.</p>
