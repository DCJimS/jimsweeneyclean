<p>When I came back to the US in 2006 after studying for several years with a meditation school in Australia, I found myself the happy recipient of large-scale &#8220;downloads&#8221; of systems for global transformation through development of certain technologies &#8211; notably creative collaboration, trust and ratings exchanges, and information visualization systems.</p>

<p>I developed these ideas with my friends <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/adamapollo'>Adam Apollo</a> and <a href='http://jacksenechal.com/'>Jack Senechal</a> over the course of several years, in numerous working sessions and impassioned conversations. The project that we saw as the capstone of this interlinked layer of &#8221;<a href='http://enlightenedstructure.org/'>Enlightened Structure</a>&#8221; we called the <a href='http://enlightenedstructure.org/trust-exchange/'>Trust Exchange</a>. An excerpt from our writings on the topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Trust Exchange will amalgamate existing ratings from any source, feeding them into a free, open, globally distributed database. Instead of creating another proprietary &#8220;silo&#8221; containing your ratings and trust information, like so many existing online systems, the Trust Exchange is a simple and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information.</p>

<p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when my luminous change agent friend <a href='http://www.shilohboss.com/personalpoetic'>Shiloh Boss</a> send me a link to an article by Venessa Miemis &#8211; who organized the delicious-looking Contact Summit last Thursday in NYC &#8211; called <a href='http://emergentbydesign.com/2011/10/06/10-projects-to-liberate-the-web/'>10 Projects to Liberate the Web</a>. The one that swept me off my feet was #13 (yes, out of 10) &#8211; <a href='http://connect.me/'>Connect.me</a>.</p>

<p>Connect.me serves up an easy to use &#8211; even slightly addictive &#8211; platform for &#8220;vouching&#8221; for people you know in various areas. For example, I vouched for my entrepreneur friend Tristan Kromer in the field of &#8220;lean startup&#8221;, and the EFF&#8217;s John Perry Barlow as a &#8220;thought leader&#8221;.</p>

<p>The folks at Connect.me have developed an excellent Trust Framework &#8211; in particular, I highly recommend their deeply thoughtful whitepaper <a href='http://blog.connect.me/whitepaper-the-personal-network'>The Personal Network</a>. As a small sample, here are their &#8220;Trust Framework Assurances&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Control: Only you decide who your personal data is shared with for what purpose
  </p>  
  <p>  
    Peace of Mind: Your data will not being used without your permission
  </p>  
  <p>  
    Freedom: You can always take your data with you and never be “locked in”
  </p>  
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href='http://connect.me/harlanknightwood'>vouching for people</a> left and right! Let&#8217;s build the trust network on Connect.me together &#8211; these people have their values in absolutely the right place, including the important promise of data portability to other networks.</p>
