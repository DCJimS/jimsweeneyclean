  <h2>About Jim</h2>

  <p> Thank you for coming to my web site.  For the past 10 years I have been helping everyone, from large pharma,
  to small businesses to large government agencies move to a virtualized and/or Cloud infrastructure.
  I have managed teams that architected, designed, built and operated large virtualized and Cloud (AWS) environments
  while helping customers to migrate their applications and get the most out of these new technologies. </p>

	<p> Previously the President and CTO of V3 Systems in Salt Lake City, I have more than 35 years of experience
  in the development and integration of a broad range of enterprise IT applications and technologies.
  I've held several roles including technical, sales and marketing positions over my career. I served as the CTO of
  GTSI Corp (now UNICOM Federal Systems) where I had served as the Manager of the Virtualization and Cloud Computing
  Consulting Practices working with different federal, state and local agencies. </p>

	<p>Prior to GTSI I've held diverse roles with numerous firms including Commodore Business Machines,
  The Singer Corporation and VA Linux Systems.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, as someone who loves to bring new technologie to market, I have been working with startup ideas of my
  own as well as helping local startups refine their pitches, attract funding sources and go to market. If there is any time
  leftover from work and those efforts,  I love tinkering with new technologies like 3D printing, arduinos and
  raspberry pi IoT computers, and robotics.
  </p>

	<h2>A Word about this website</h2>

  <a href="https://github.com/"><img style="right: 30px; border: 0;" src="https://github.com/jamesflorentino/fork-ribbons/raw/master/ribbons/blue-white.png" alt="Fork me on GitHub"></img></a>

	<p>This entire serverless web site is hosted on S3 storage out of the Amazon Web Services Cloud, having been cached at the edges of
  their network by Amazon CloudFront. The repository is hosted on GitHub, and the design (but not the content) is freely open to everyone. I use
  Git with Atom and Jekyll on my Apple laptop to create and maintain the site, committing changes and sync'ing to Github when I am ready to
  release a new version.  Then I simply generate a new site with jekyll with all the latest blog posts andusing S3_website utility to copy it to
  the S3 bucket.  The only real trick is making sure the authoritative domain points to the correct (i.e., most current) S3 bucket as I use the
  "blue"/"green" method where I have one production bucket and one test bucket at all times.
 </p>

	<p> While the above sounds complicated, it is really very easy and provides several benefits.  It allows me to edit the site easily (with Atom),
  keep version control current (with GitHub), keep testing with different S3 buckets, upload new blog posts easily and quickly (with Jekyll/S3_website),
  and host the site in a manner that makes it easy for you the user to get to even when there is power problems here in Northern VA., thanks to
  Amazon's network!. Lastly, if I ever wind up ont he front page of the Washington Post (for good reasons, of course) then the site will scale
  automatically as needed.
