	<h2>A Word about this website</h2>
	
	<a href="https://github.com/"><img style="right: 30px; border: 0;" src="https://github.com/jamesflorentino/fork-ribbons/raw/master/ribbons/blue-white.png" alt="Fork me on GitHub"></a>
	
	<p>This entire site is hosted on S3 storage out of the Amazon Web Services Cloud, having been cached at the edges of their network by Amazon CloudFront. The 
	repository is hosted on GitHub, and the design (but not the content) is freely open to everyone. I use Git with Eclipse and Jekyll on my Apple Mac mini to create and 
	maintain the site, committing changes and sync'ing to Github when I am ready to release a new version.  Then I simply pull down a copy of the repository onto an AWS EC2 instance and upload it to my S3 bucket. 
	The only real trick is making sure the authoritative domain points to the correct (i.e., most current) S3 bucket. </p>
	
	<p> While the above sounds complicated, it is really very easy and provides several benefits.  It allows me to edit the site easily (with Eclipe), keep version control current (with Git / GitHub), upload new blog posts easily and quickly (with Jekyll), and host the
	site in a manner that makes it easy for you the user to get to even when there is power problems here in Northern VA., thanks to Amazon's network!</p>
