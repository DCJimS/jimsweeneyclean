<p>I was recently working with my life coach and she asked me what seemed like
an innocuous question. ‚ÄúYour LinkedIn profile and work history shows you
to be a technologist. Why do you have a website? What do you want you readers to get out of it‚Äù?
OK, so that was more than one question, but she certainly made me think. It took me a while, but I
realized that I wanted to stop writing about technology and focus more on business problems, and
the solutions to them. Maybe I won‚Äôt stop completely writing about technology because technology
is still fascinating to me, but what keeps the business running is not only a good product but a
well-functioning, motivated business.</p>

<p>For me personally, I love the startup world. In fact, when she and I last spoke, it was a problem
filled Friday (I am usually totally drained by Friday) and my energy level was low. But
as she and I spoke more about it, my juices started flowing and I
got up off my chair and started pacing as we talked. My energy was flowing again! Why? Because we
were talking about something I love.</p>

<p>It dawned on me then what I have told younger employees from the time I was about 30: ‚ÄúDo want
you love to do‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I go, I hear from younger employees all the time: ‚ÄúI hate
it here‚Äù, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt like sales‚Äù (or marketing, or whatever department they are in). My
answer has always been the same: ‚ÄúThen go do something else. Go do something that brings you
happiness every day (or at least most days)‚Äù.</p>

<p>Everyone is different and we are all motivated
differently. Don‚Äôt wait for us to tell you to leave because you hate it here so much that
your performance is suboptimal. Go find something that you like (strike that: LOVE) to do.
Oprah Winfrey paraphrased the old quote brilliantly: ‚ÄúFollow your passion. Do what you love,
and the money will follow. Most people don‚Äôt believe it, but it‚Äôs true‚Äù.</p>

<p>So, what motivates me? Technology, yes, that is true. But more than that small companies
that have a good idea or product. They may need funding (I can and will write many more
posts about my experiences there), or organizational assistance, or even someone to bring
life to the team. That‚Äôs what I have been doing for the last several months on a very
large federal government project. I take over teams that might have become complacent
or stale (or maybe were never a cohesive team in the first place) and re-energize
them. In the process I have supplemented my technical knowledge of Cloud computing,
VMware virtualization and countless other products but I‚Äôve also brought value to
the company by organizing and motivating various teams to perform at higher levels.
And while that has been extraordinarily challenging, it has been very rewarding.</p>

<p>So, what motivates you? While you ponder that question, I‚Äôll start writing about my experiences with
startups!</p>

<p>Until then, thanks for reading. Follow me on twitter at @DCJimS</p>
