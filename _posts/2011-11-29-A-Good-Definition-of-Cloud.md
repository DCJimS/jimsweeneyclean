title: "A Good Definition of Cloud"
---

I just read a post on another blog that spoke about the definition of cloud being *an application-centric approach 
to IT*.  I was really floored by how much I think this definition really misses the mark.  And that got me thinking.
  What is a good definition of cloud? As I did my research I came across this article at Cloud Advocates that 
claims there are 27 different definitions for cloud computing!  Yikes!  If we are all going to understand 
cloud and receive maximum benefit from the cloud, shouldn't we all agree on the same definition?  At least that 
would be a good starting point for further exploration.  Perhaps as a starting point we should look at the 
The National Institute of Standards version, which they released last month:

>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient,  on-demand network access to a shared  pool 
>of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that  can be 
>rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

I have really come to like this definition. The folks at NIST have once again hit the nail on the head.   It 
handles IaaS (servers, storage and networks), as well as PaaS and SaaS clouds (applications and services).  It 
is also accurate and appropriate for public, private, hybrid and even community clouds.  In fact, I cannot think 
of a single use-case for cloud that this definition does not cover.

Back to the  *application-centric approach to IT* definition.  Applications are in fact a part of cloud. That is 
true.  But, if we are going to shorten the definition of cloud down to a couple of words,  shouldn't the word 
*application* be *services*? After all, Salesforce and other PaaS clouds are many applications but ordered as 
one *service*.  And if IT just presents applications to users, how would users know how to put them all together 
into a *service*? For example, would I (as a user) order the *exchange* application only to find out that I 
needed to order DNS, DHCP and maybe even a client too?  No. I would or should order the *email service* which 
includes all the applications and interfaces necessary to get me my email, bundled into one service that 
meets or exceeds my business needs.

And how does this short definition handle something like PaaS clouds, which include editors, compilers, versioning 
systems, etc?  What about something like Amazon Mechanical Turk from AWS (which really isn't an application at 
all, but is in fact, covered by the NIST definition).

I prefer to think of cloud as a *service-centric operations model*. where IT working in conjunction with 
business users defines and appropriately sources services that meet the business needs of its users, and then 
makes them available to users on demand in a pay-per-use model.  But let's face it, this definition is not as 
elegant or even as accurate as the NIST definition. So when I have more than 10 seconds in front of a customer, 
I'm going to use the NIST definition.  In my humble opinion it's the one we all should be using. After all, 
a common understanding of the subject we are talking about is really the only way to progress towards understanding 
the benfits, the use cases and the best migration path towards cloud.
