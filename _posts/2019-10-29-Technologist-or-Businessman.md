10/29/2019 What Motivates you?

I was recently working with my life coach and she asked me what seemed like an innocuous question.  ?Your LinkedIn profile and work history shows you to be a technologist.  Why do you have a website?  What do you want you readers to get out of it??

OK, so that was more than one question, but she certainly made me think.  It took me a while, but I realized that I wanted to stop writing about technology and focus more on business problems, and the solutions to them. Maybe I won?t stop completely writing about technology because technology is still fascinating to me, but what keeps the business running is not only a good product but a well-functioning, motivated business.  For me personally, I love the startup world. In fact, when she and I last spoke, it was a problem filled Friday (I am usually totally drained by Friday) and my energy level was low.  But as she and I spoke more about it, my juices started flowing and I got up off of my chair and started pacing as we talked.  

It dawned on me then what I have told younger employees from the time I was about 30: ?Do want you love to do?.  It doesn?t matter where I go, I hear from younger employees all the time: ?I hate it here?, ?I really don?t like sales? (or marketing, or whatever department they are in).  My answer has always been the same: ?Then go do something else.  Go do something that brings you happiness every day (or at least most days)?. Everyone is different and we are all motivated differently.  Don?t wait for us to tell you to leave because you hate it here so much that your performance is suboptimal.  Go find something that you like (strike that ? LOVE) to do. Oprah Winfrey paraphrased the old quote: ?Follow your passion. Do what you love, and the money will follow. Most people don?t believe it, but it?s true.?

So, what motivates me?  Technology, yes, that is true.  But more than that small companies that have a good idea or product.  They may need funding (I can and will write many more posts about my experiences there), or organizational assistance, or even someone to bring life to the team.  That?s what I have been doing for the last several months on a very large federal government project. I take over teams that might have become complacent or stale (or maybe were never a cohesive team in the first place) and re-energize them. In the process I have supplemented my technical knowledge of Cloud computing, VMware virtualization and countless other products but I?ve also brought value to the contract by organizing and motivating various teams under my purview. And while that has been extraordinarily challenging, it has been very rewarding to see the results.
Until then, thanks for reading.
