title: "A QUick Review of the PaaS Cloud"
---

I recently created the latest chapter on the book I am writing about Cloud Computing in the Public Sector.  It was the chapter 
I was dreading the most because it was on the PaaS (platform as a service) public cloud.  This is perhaps the least 
understood, and certainly from all indications I have, the least used in the public sector at this time.

Platform as a Service clouds allow you to rapidly develop and scale web applications in the cloud. You don.t have the control 
over the existing infrastructure that you do in an IaaS cloud, where you can control the OS, the patching of that OS and your 
application, but what you get is rapid, easy development.  As another example of this simpleness, you don't get to specify 
the parameters that you will use to scale up and scale down the number of web servers used to deliver your application as 
you do in the AWS cloud.  What you get is a simple, easy to use development platform with an integrated development environment 
and one touch *upload to the cloud* features.

Some of the major players in this market are:

**Microsoft**.  Yep. The same folks that make Windows and Office 365. With their Windows Azure product, and their existing 
SQL development tools,  they have a nice offering which works very well.

**Google**.  We all know the Google browser and some of you may know Google from their Software as a Service offering Google Apps.
But with Google App Engine, you can rapidly develop web applications, test them with a built in emulator that comes as part 
of the development environment, and with one click, upload the application to the Google cloud.

**VMware**.   What did you say?  VMware is a virtualization company that only has a private or hybrid IaaS cloud offering, 
right? Well they also announced their PaaS offering about 9 months ago.  It has support for a lot of different languages 
and databases. It even has an open source component and is becoming a major player in this aspect of cloud.

These are two of the critical factors in choosing a PaaS providers: What language do you want to use and what database 
do you want to use? When it comes to languages and DB support, it appears that no two vendors are alike.

So how did the chapter go? Great, thanks to a friend of mine who is a developer.  He came over one day and in just a few 
minutes we had downloaded the Google App Enginer IDE (Integrated Development Environment), imported some sample code, tested 
it on the included simulator and uploaded it (*with one key click*) to the Google cloud. Our experience on the Windows 
Azure environment was very much the same. Download a few development tools, and you are ready to begin development and testing.

Again, for rapid development of scalable web applications without having to worry about the cost and complexity of 
buying and managing the underlying hardware and software and provisioning hosting capabilities, PaaS should be one 
of the options considered!

As always, thanks for reading.
