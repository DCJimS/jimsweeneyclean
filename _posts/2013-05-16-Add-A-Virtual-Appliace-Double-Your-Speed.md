title: "Add A Virtual Desktop Appliance.  Double Your Speed!"
---

In my last blog post I spoke a little about the performance increases that many users see when running virtual desktops on an appliance.

Consider this example:  The Children’s Hospital of Birmingham Alabama.  (Read the full case study here). If you don’t want to read the entire case study, here are a few highlights:

 1400 doctors and nurses throughout the hospital were running VMware View virtual desktops.

 Hospital IT was running VMware View with Cisco UCS Blades and an EMC SAN.

Before adding a V3 Appliance, there was a delay of a minute and 15 seconds between the time they logged in and the time that the actual virtual desktop was loaded and ready for user input.

After some networking configuration and architectural issues were discovered and remedied, the user opted to replace one ESX server with a V3 Systems virtual desktop appliance. 

Before I share their amazing results with you, keep one thing in mind:  the user replaced only one server with a V3 virtual desktop Appliance.  The user did not replace his entire server and storage infrastructure to use the V3 Systems Appliance.

The results speak for themselves. After replacing just one ESXi server with a V3 System virtual desktop appliance, the time between login and a desktop that was ready for user input was just 22 seconds! That is an amazing increase in performance – greater than 50% in fact!  Needless to say, the customer was very happy with this performance – and the 1400 doctors and nurses who use virtual desktops were happy too.

If you already have a SAN or NAS and have servers that are running your vSphere infrastructure, you shouldn’t have to replace your existing infrastructure to get better performance. As we’ve just seen, it is much more efficient – and cost effective – to use a V3 virtual desktop appliance to increase the performance of your virtual desktops, as opposed to the user data, preferences, and data files.

Other institutions and businesses have experienced similar performance gains simply by switching one (or a few) of their servers with appliances from V3 Systems. You’ll find their case studies on our web site, www.v3sys.com. As other business and educational customers discover the advantages of using a V3 Appliance, we’ll add their case studies to our website, too. So stop by our site often to read exciting updates.

Until then, thanks for reading.
