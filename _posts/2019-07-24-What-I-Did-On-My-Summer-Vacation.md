title: "What I did on my summer vacation!"
---

WOW!. It's sure been a long time.  (Almost 6 years to be more precise).  A lot has happened in my life and in technology. I've been busy with projects for various government agencies, and major pharmecuticals architecing, designing and implementing Virtualization and AWS Cloud solutions.  It's been fun. But one thing I have missed is writing about it.  So... time to catch up.

For a first step, I'm working on the web site.  The "new book" is now 6 years old and I was fortunate to write a chapter in the "Encyclopedia of Cloud Computer", which was a real honor.  You might remember, back when I was actively posting on a regular basis, that I was proud to be using jekyll for blogging (it really maskes it easy) and hosting my website without using a server in AWS S3 storage.  While that was pretty state of the art then, its not 6 years later.  So follow me as I update my site, move to a new serverless architecture and write about all the cool things I've been doing in both Cloud Computing and Virtualization 

I promise, the next blog post wont be 6 years from now!

Until then, thanks for reading.
