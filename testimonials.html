<h1>Testimonial Comments</h1>

	<p class="quote">"Thank you for covering our product in your book. You are a thought leader and a champion of the Cloud movement."
	<strong>Rockville, Md</strong></p>

	<p class="quote">"....I had the opportunity to read your book and found it to be a valuable and informative read. In particular, I was interested in your take on private clouds given that many speakers at the Conference were highlighting these as a dominant focus. In the face of their arguments, I found your position on the economics and scalability of true public clouds compelling. Your book was also a great tutorial on all of the various offers in the marketplace and saved me a great deal of time coming up to speed on all these permutations. Thank You!"
